Crop Disease Detection Using Deep Learning
Project Overview:

This project detects crop diseases from leaf images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the New Plant Diseases Dataset (Kaggle).
It enables real-time disease prediction through a simple web interface, helping farmers identify plant diseases early and reduce crop loss using AI.

Key Features:
1).Disease classification from leaf images using deep learning
2).Supports multiple crop and disease categories
3).Real-time image prediction via web app
4).Easy-to-use interface for non-technical users
